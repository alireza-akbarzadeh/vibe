Here’s a clean, ready-to-use **prompt for generating the Artist Profile Page**:

---

**Prompt**

Design a **modern Artist Profile Page** for a streaming platform (similar to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music). The goal is to create the **best possible UI/UX** with a premium, minimal, and highly visual style.

The page should display:

- Artist **hero section** with large header image or gradient background
- Artist **name, follower count, genres, country**
- **Follow button** with animated states
- **Artist bio** (short description, expandable for full bio)
- **Top songs section**
- **Albums section**
- **Related artists section**
- Optional: **featured video or featured track**

Layout expectations:

- Clean card-based grid and horizontal carousels
- Strong typography
- High-quality artist imagery
- Dark, music-platform visual style
- Focus on content, avoid clutter

Interaction & animation:

- Use **Framer Motion**
- Smooth entrance animations for sections
- Hover effects on albums and songs
- Animated “Follow” button transitions
- Staggered item animations
- Micro-interactions on play buttons

UX requirements:

- Mobile responsive
- Sticky hero while scrolling OR parallax motion
- Accessibility considerations
- Clear hierarchy between sections

Requested output from the AI:

- Full layout description
- Component list and architecture
- Interaction and animation details
- Best-practice UI/UX considerations

Optional tech hints:

- React or Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

Style goal:

- Premium
- Minimal
- Cinematic music-platform vibe

---

If you want, I can also:

- tailor this **for Next.js + app router**
- tailor it for **mobile-only app**
- add **player controls section**
- add **concerts & events section**
- generate **component names and props**
